# Setup

Plugin to help you find perfect camera settings. Choose from over 840 configs.

Due to limitations from bakkesmod this will not work in multiplayer so instead you can use the values shown and set them in your own settings.

* Download **setup.dll** from [Releases](https://github.com/0xleft/setup/releases/latest) and put in your BakkesMod/plugin folder along with other dlls.
* Use pluginmanager to load the dll
